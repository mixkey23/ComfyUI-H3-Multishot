      colour mode drives each shot to a rolling house and leaves a hard step
      at every join (measured 29% warmth). A smoothed-local target is no
      better for chained video: a shot boundary is a STEP, a wide smoothing
      window turns it into a ramp, and the gain then ramps with it instead of
      cancelling it (unit-tested: a 15% step came out 13.5%). Driving every
      frame to a single number removes steps by construction, because every
      frame lands on the same number.
    * LUMA ONLY. Texture drift cannot be fixed here. Blur is the only lever
      available after the fact, and blur removes real detail along with the
      model's invented detail - it satisfies a metric by destroying
      information. A ratcheting chain wants a shorter chain, an anchor-only

# AUTO ACTIVATION RESERVE
#
# VRAM has two tenants with opposite tolerance for being remote. WEIGHTS
# stream well: sequential, known order, prefetched behind ~50s of compute per
# step, so 20GB offloaded costs well under a second. The ALLOCATOR POOL
# (activations) does not stream: it is random-access and re-touched all step,
# and when it does not fit, the driver evicts blind mid-step. Measured on a
# 3090: starving the pool by ~3GB = 533 s/it vs 99 s/it. Measured on a 5090:
# 168W at "99% utilisation" - a card waiting, not computing.
#
# So the correct split is reserve >= pool, and stream whatever weights do not
# fit - overshooting is nearly free, undershooting is 5-10x. The pool scales
# with the render shape, which is why any hand-set number (a GB figure, a
# memory_usage_factor) is correct for exactly one resolution and a trap at
# every other: LOWER the resolution with a fixed factor and the reserve
# shrinks below the pool - the render gets SLOWER, the opposite of what any
# person expects.
#
# This engine removes the knob:
#   - memory_required(input_shape) is overridden with a function of the
#     ACTUAL shape comfy passes at load time - never a constant.
#   - Unmeasured shapes reserve 60% of currently-free VRAM: generous enough
#     to be cliff-proof at any resolution, and only slightly slower than
#     optimal (a few more GB of weights stream).
#   - Our samplers measure the true allocator peak of every run and cache it
#     per (GPU, model, shape-cells) in the user dir. From the second run at
#     a shape, the reserve is measured * 1.25 - per machine, no telemetry to
#     read, no number to know.

# anchor, the level COMPOUNDS - a 6-shot chain measured 3.3x sharper by its
# last shot than its first. The loop: anchor at level L -> the model generates
# its continuation at ~1.25-1.47 x L -> that output tail is the next anchor.
# Gain > 1 in an autoregressive loop ratchets.

# These helpers measure texture energy (variance of a 3x3 Laplacian on luma)

    (render-verified failure: a deep-shadow block got remapped to mid-grey
    and the whole shot posterised into magenta/green).

    The correction is a per-channel GAIN in linear light, not an affine
    transfer: exposure and tint drift between chained shots is multiplicative
    (a gain), and an additive offset in linear space lifts black levels by
    the full drift amount - a 0.02-linear offset turns true black into ~0.17
    gamma, ruinous in dark scenes. Gains map black to exactly black, are
    monotone per channel (posterisation impossible), and correct the axis
    that actually drifts at joins (luma/tint). Covariance matching is
    deliberately dropped; `house_cov` and `block` are kept for signature
    compatibility (`block` only sets the application chunk size).

    Guard rail: gains are clamped to [0.7, 1.4] - a correction beyond that
    means the shot genuinely changed (a light went out, a door opened) and
    colour transfer must not fight real scene changes.
    Measured: colour is CONSTANT within a shot (flat to three decimals
    across a whole shot) and steps hard at the boundary. So one gain per
    shot is the right shape of correction - what was wrong before was the
